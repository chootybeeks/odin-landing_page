Landing Page Project

An exciting project to create a cool looking landing page! This is a big project, but it's easier when broken down into smaller 
pieces. Currently, I am figuring out how to code the .html document for the subheader. I will update when necessary.

The subheader was pretty straightforward, though I ran into a bit of an issue when trying to style the button. The Chrome inspector kept saying 'invalid properties' for the font-size and color, and I tried to troubleshoot what I was doing wrong but I could not figure it out. I ended up just restarting VSCode and Chrome and I was no longer getting the 'invalid properties' warning. I did not change my code at all so maybe it was just one of those things.

The information section was easier than I initially anticipated, mostly due to it being similar to an exercise I had done previously so I was able to reference that to help guide me through it.

The quote section only has two items within it, so that was also a pretty easy section.

The call to action section intimdated me at first because upon looking at it I was unsure of how to get the background color to cover everthing in the section, but I was able to figure it out fairly quickly and after that the footer section was trivial.


Overall, this was a fun and challenging project. It took me around 4-6 hours to complete, and my method was focusing on one section at a time, completing each 100% and then moving on to the next section. The most difficult section was probably the subheader, because getting the image to fit correctly was a bit troubling.
