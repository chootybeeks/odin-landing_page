Landing Page Project

An exciting project to create a cool looking landing page! This is a big project, but it's easier when broken down into smaller 
pieces. Currently, I am figuring out how to code the .html document for the subheader. I will update when necessary.

The subheader was pretty straightforward, though I ran into a bit of an issue when trying to style the button. The Chrome inspector kept saying 'invalid properties' for the font-size and color, and I tried to troubleshoot what I was doing wrong but I could not figure it out. I ended up just restarting VSCode and Chrome and I was no longer getting the 'invalid properties' warning. I did not change my code at all so maybe it was just one of those things.
